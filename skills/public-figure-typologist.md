# Public Figure Typologist

## Purpose

Create respectful, ethical typology profiles for public figures based on publicly available information using three typological systems.

## When to Use

- User requests typology for a public figure (celebrity, politician, military leader, etc.)
- User wants analysis based on public statements, interviews, documented behavior
- User asks to "type" someone

## When NOT to Use

- Private individuals without their consent
- Any clinical diagnosis claims
- Commercial purposes without consent

## Ethical Framework

### ALWAYS Required: Disclaimer

Every typology analysis MUST include:

```
DISCLAIMER: This typology is an interpretation based on publicly available 
information only. It does not constitute a psychological diagnosis. 
No examination was conducted. The subject has not consented to this analysis. 
This is opinion, not fact.
```

### Acceptable Scenarios

| Scenario | OK? | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Public figure (academic analysis) | ✅ | With disclaimer |
| Public figure (non-commercial) | ✅ | With disclaimer |
| Private individual | ❌ | Needs consent |
| Clinical diagnosis | ❌ | Never claim this |
| Commercial use | ❌ | Needs consent |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Research (Required)

Before any typing, research publicly available information:

1. Search for recent interviews, speeches, public statements
2. Find biographical information
3. Look for documented leadership style, decisions
4. Find quotes about values, worldview, goals

**Required**: At least 3-5 public sources

### Step 2: Analyze for Evidence

For each typological system, find evidence for:

#### Temporistics (Strategic - Past/Present/Future/Eternity)
- Past: What past experiences shaped them?
- Present: How do they handle current reality?
- Future: What are their goals/vision?
- Eternity: What is their sense of meaning/legacy?

#### Psychosophy (Operational - 4 Functions × 4 Positions)

Each person has ONE position (1/2/3/4) for each of 4 aspects = 2-letter type!

**Type format**: [Aspect][Position] + [Aspect][Position]
- Example: LE means 1st position in Logic, 2nd in Emotion

**How to determine**:
- Which aspect is LEADING (1)? = What they naturally drive
- Which aspect is CREATIVE (2)? = What they develop with others
- Which is VULNERABLE (3)? = What causes anxiety
- Which is ROLE (4)? = How they present

**Reference**: `wiki/sources/psychosophy-detailed.md` for full function descriptions

#### Socionics (Tactical - 8 functions)
- Leading function: What drives them?
- Creative function: What do they excel at?
- Vulnerable function: What do they struggle with?
- Role function: How do they present themselves?

### Step 3: Draft Typology

## Summary Profile

| System | Type Format | Example |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Temporistics | БНПВ (F N P E) | User notation |
| Psychosophy | ФВЛЭ (F V L E) | User notation |
| Socionics | СЛЭ (SLE) | 4-letter code |

## Key Observations

### [Category]
- [Evidence from public sources]

---

## Temporistics Analysis

### [Type determination]
**Rationale**: [Explanation with evidence]

[Detailed temporal analysis]

---

## Psychosophy Analysis (4 aspects × 4 positions = LEVF format)

### Determining Positions

Each aspect (L/E/V/F) has position 1-4:

| Position | What to look for |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 (Leading) | What they naturally drive, confident in |
| 2 (Creative) | What they develop with others |
| 3 (Vulnerable) | What causes anxiety/doubt |
| 4 (Role) | How they present externally |

**Output format**: 4-character like "1L2E3V4F" or simplified "LEV" (just leading + creative)

### Analysis

[Which position for each: L, E, V, F]

## Socionics Analysis

### [Type determination]
**Rationale**: [Explanation with evidence]

[Function-by-function breakdown]

## Notes

1. This is speculative analysis based on public behavior only
2. No examination conducted — cannot verify accuracy
3. Typology is opinion, not psychological diagnosis
4. Subject has not consented to this analysis
```

### Step 4: Review and Save

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Disclaimer is present
- [ ] No clinical diagnosis claims
- [ ] Based on public sources only
- [ ] Clear this is opinion, not fact
- [ ] Non-commercial framing

## Typology Reference

### Temporistics Type (4 letters in EXTERNAL order!)

**User's notation**: БНПВ (F N P E in Russian letters)

| Letter (EN) | Russian | Aspect | Core Question |
|-------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| P | П | Past | "Who am I?" |
| N | Н | Present | "Where is my place?" |
| F | Б | Future | "Where am I going?" |
| E | В | Eternity | "Why am I?" |

**Format**: **Letter order = position 1, 2, 3, 4**

**Example**: БНПВ = Future 1st, Present 2nd, Past 3rd, Eternity 4th

**Verification for Zaluzhnyi**:
- Future (Б) = 1st: Victory drives him — "entire occupied territory must be liberated"
- Present (Н) = 2nd: Lives in war reality — "every day it's those who were killed"
- Past (П) = 3rd: Soviet legacy transformation in progress — "transformation remains irreversible"
- Eternity (В) = 4th: Legacy is external output, not primary focus

**Reference**: See `wiki/sources/temporistics-detailed.md`

### Psychosophy Type (4 letters in EXTERNAL order!)

**CRITICAL FORMAT**: Letters = ASPECTS (L/E/V/F), ORDER = POSITION 1/2/3/4

**User's notation**: ФВЛЭ (F V L E in Russian letters)

| Letter (EN) | Russian | Aspect | Domain |
|-------------|---------|--------|---------|
| L | Л | Logic | Truth, structure, analysis |
| E | Э | Emotion | Feelings, relationships, values |
| V | В | Volition | Goals, decisions, will |
| F | Ф | Physics | Material, comfort, resources |

**Format**: **First letter = aspect at position 1**, second = position 2, etc.

**Example**: ФВЛЭ (F-V-L-E) means:
- Position 1: Physics (Ф)
- Position 2: Volition (В)
- Position 3: Logic (Л)
- Position 4: Emotion (Э)

**IMPORTANT**: Don't confuse with format where each letter shows position number!

Reference: See `wiki/sources/psychosophy-detailed.md`

### Socionics Type — Key Correction!

**IMPORTANT**: Different from my initial typing!

**Common mistake**: Assuming vision/Intuition (Ne/Ni) leads for strategic commanders.
**Correction**: Many military leaders lead with **Se** (External Sensing), not Ne!

SLE (СЛЭ) = Se leading, Te creative, Fe role, Ne vulnerable:
- Se = Action-oriented, battlefield adaptability, "kill enemy today"
- Te = Systematic doctrine, external logic
- Fe = Human touch as role, but not leading
- Ne = Strategic vision is VULNERABLE (4th), not strength!

**User's notation**: СЛЭ (SLE), ИЛЭ (ILE), ЛСИ (LSI), etc.

Socionics uses 8 functions in 4 positions:

| Function | Full Name |
|----------|-----------|
| **Ne** | External Intuition |
| **Ni** | Internal Intuition |
| **Se** | External Sensing (ACTION) |
| **Si** | Internal Sensing |
| **Te** | External Logic |
| **Ti** | Internal Logic |
| **Fe** | External Ethics |
| **Fi** | Internal Ethics |

**Model A (8 types in each of 4 clubs)**:
- **Alpha**: ILE, SEI, EII, LII
- **Beta**: SLE, ESFj, EIE, LSI
- **Gamma**: SLI, IEI, LIE, ESE
- **Delta**: ESI, IEE, SEV, ILI

**Type format**: 4 letters in order Leading, Creative, Role, Vulnerable

**Example**: SLE (Se-Te-Fe-Ne) = External Sensing leading, External Logic creative, External Ethics role, External Intuition vulnerable

**Verification for Zaluzhnyi**: СЛЭ (SLE) is more accurate than LIE because:
- He is ACTION-oriented: "kill enemy today", "not a show"
- His vision (Ne) is secondary to his tactical action (Se)
- He delegated to commanders, didn't lead with big picture

**Reference**: See `wiki/sources/socionics-detailed.md`

## Examples

### Example: Zaluzhnyi (Completed)

- Research process
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Three-system analysis
- Proper disclaimer

## Key Corrections from User Verification

### Socionics Correction: СЛЭ (SLE) is valid, not just ILE/LIE

**Common mistake**: Assuming strategic leaders = Ne (intuition) leading.
**Reality**: Many leaders lead with Se (action/sensing), especially military.

For Zaluzhnyi:
- My initial: LIE (Ne leading)
- User corrected: СЛЭ (SLE = Se leading)
- **Why**: He focused on tactical action, adaptability, "kill enemy today" not abstract vision
- **Lesson**: Don't assume vision types for commanders!

### Temporistics Correction: Verified with Zaluzhnyi

User's БНПВ (Future 1st) fits better than my NPFE:
- Future = victory drives him
- Present = daily war reality
- Past = Soviet transformation in progress
- Eternity = external legacy

### Psychosophy: STILL NEEDS VERIFICATION

User says ФВЛЭ but format unclear:
- Does ФВЛЭ mean F1, V2, L3, E4?
- Or different format?

**Evidence for Zaluzhnyi** (need user clarification):
- Logic strong: systematic reformer, "I read a lot of books"
- Will strong: persistent, "I have to live with it"
- Emotion as role: human touch but keeps distance
- Physics: low priority (lives in bunker)

This suggests "LV..." format (Logic 1st), not "Ф..." (Physics 1st).

**Action needed**: Ask user to clarify Psychosophy format!
