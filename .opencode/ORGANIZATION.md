## Principles Applied

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **One root** | master-orchestrator only |
| **Max depth 3** | orchestrator → team → specialist |
| **Least privilege** | Each agent has minimal tools |
| **One job** | Each agent specializes |
| **Team memory** | Shared files in .opencode/data/ |

## Memory Architecture

| Tier | Scope | Agent |
|------|-------|-------|
| Short-term | Current conversation | All |
| Long-term | Personal patterns | Typing agents |
| Team | Shared knowledge | Team leads |

## Workflows

### User Flow: "What's my military role?"

```
1. User → master-orchestrator
2. Orchestrator → (route to typing team)
3. Typing team → get all 3 types
4. Types → military-specialty-advisor
5. Advisor → recommendation
```

### Update Flow: "Update military roles"

```
1. User → master-orchestrator  
2. Orchestrator → military-roles-researcher
3. Researcher → web search → updates data
4. Notify military-specialty-advisor
```

### Quality Flow: "Check wiki"

```
1. Cron/Manual → master-orchestrator
2. Orchestrator → wiki-consistency-checker
3. Checker → scan → report issues
```

## Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|--------|

## Tool Allocation
